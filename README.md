# proton-template

## Getting started

Try out implementing these simple apps:

- https://github.com/denshya/proton/tree/main/demos/simple/src/tictactoe
- https://github.com/denshya/proton/tree/main/demos/simple/src/products-table
- https://github.com/denshya/proton/tree/main/demos/simple/src/Circles

These simple components:

- https://github.com/denshya/proton/tree/main/demos/simple/src/app/ui/MiniProfile
- https://github.com/denshya/proton/tree/main/demos/simple/src/app/ui/EditableAvatar
- https://github.com/denshya/proton/tree/main/demos/simple/src/app/ui/DropDown
- https://github.com/denshya/proton/tree/main/demos/simple/src/app/ui/Selector

And in the end, try implementing the Market mini-app:
https://github.com/denshya/proton/tree/main/demos/simple/src/areas/market

It includes many other ui components, so I think it would be somewhat challenging - exactly what you need to grasp the Proton.
